# CAIS Student Leadership Conference 2018

## Web site

This project will store files used to render the website for the CAIS Student Leadership Conference. In 2018, the conference is being held at Lakefield College School.

## Required software

Students, first download and install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Use this as the external editor when you are writing HTML and CSS files. You will continue to use Xcode to manage source code and use source control with GitHub.

## Reading

First, read about [the semantic web](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271) and then begin [learning HTML](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/).

## Project management

Next, meet with stakeholders and determine requirements. Mr. Gordon will walk you through how to use the project management features built into GitHub.

## Use Source Control

Source control is a must. Commit frequently with descriptive messages. Students, since you are working as partners, you will need to learn how to both push and pull code to keep your project in sync.

Once you have finished completing HTML and CSS tutorials, you will begin writing code that meets specific user requirements.

From that point forward all code you commit should be tied to an issue. This is a must for an organized project. Again, Mr. Gordon will show you the basics.
